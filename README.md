# OberonCompiler

An old school project for my compiler construction course that currently tokenizes and parses the syntax of the Oberon programming language.

Something is missing here though… Where's the assembly generation!? Good question, as it turns out assembly generation is hard, like, really hard. I’ll get to it someday for sure!

Now I know what you're thinking - "Oberon? What's that?"

Man, aren't we all? 

My professor had an attachment to this programming language. The same sort of attachment he had to haskel, ms dos, and any technology older than 1990. 

It was this same professor who taught me x86 assembly, theory of computing, and programming languages. Or in other words, things that sound cool, but end up having much more math in them than you might think. 

Overall though, his contribution to my education may have been more impactful than anyone else. For that reason this code remains, and I’ll finish it when he learns to open powerpoint in less than half an hour.

I salute you Mr. Herman, for teaching me much more than I ever gave you credit for, and for ensuring that no matter how late I was to your classes, by the time I sat down, it would be at least ten more minutes before you had bent modern day windows to your will.
